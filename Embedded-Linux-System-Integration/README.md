# Embedded Linux System Integration

This folder contains exercises and solutions designed to help you integrate and manage various components in an embedded Linux system. The focus is on understanding key aspects like licensing, compilation, device trees, different software stacks, and a brief exploration of device drivers.

## Objectives

- Licensing: Learn about different open-source licenses relevant to embedded Linux development, including how to choose the right license for your project and how to comply with licensing requirements.

- Compilation: Understand the process of cross-compilation for embedded systems, including setting up a cross-compilation environment, and compiling the kernel, bootloader, and user-space applications.

- Device Tree: Explore the role of device trees in embedded systems, learn how to write and modify device tree source files, and how to integrate them with the Linux kernel for accurate hardware representation.

- Software Stacks: Delve into the integration of different software stacks (e.g., networking, multimedia, etc.) in an embedded Linux environment, understanding how to configure and optimize them for specific hardware.

- Device Drivers: Get an introduction to device drivers, including how to compile and load basic drivers, and how to integrate them into your embedded system.
