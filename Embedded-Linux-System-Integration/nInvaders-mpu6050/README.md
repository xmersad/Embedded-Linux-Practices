# nInvaders-mpu6050 Project

Welcome to the `nInvaders-mpu6050` project! This project will guide you through the process of building a minimal Embedded Linux system to run the classic `nInvaders` game, controlled by an MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope module. This exercise is designed to help you understand system integration in Embedded Linux by combining software compilation, device tree configuration, and driver modification.

**Difficulty Level**: Intermediate


## 1. Introduction

In this exercise, you will:

- Compile the `ncurses` library.
- Compile the `nInvaders` game using the `ncurses` library.
- Build a minimal root filesystem, bootloader, and kernel image with the necessary drivers.
- Configure the device tree to include the MPU6050 module.
- Transfer the compiled software to your target board.
- Explore multiple methods to enable control of the `nInvaders` game using the MPU6050 sensor.

### **Project Overview**

The goal of this project is to play the `nInvaders` game on an embedded system, using an MPU6050 accelerometer/gyroscope module as the control interface. The player will control the spaceship in the game by tilting the MPU6050 module. Specifically, the spaceship should move left or right based on the tilt along the X-axis of the MPU6050.

This project serves as an excellent opportunity to practice and understand various aspects of Embedded Linux, from building and configuring the system to integrating external hardware.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, ensure you have the following:

- **Tools & Software**:
  - A cross-compilation toolchain appropriate for your target board.
  - `ncurses` library source code.
  - `nInvaders` game source code.
  - MPU6050 driver source or compatible kernel.
  - A minimal Linux distribution image builder (e.g., Buildroot, Yocto).
  - A serial terminal program (e.g., `minicom`, `screen`) for communication with the target board.

- **Hardware**:
  - A target board (e.g., Raspberry Pi, BeagleBone).
  - An MPU6050 module connected to your target board via I2C.
  - Access to a UART interface for console output.

- **Knowledge**:
  - Basic understanding of Embedded Linux systems.
  - Familiarity with compiling software from source.
  - Basic knowledge of device trees and Linux kernel configuration.

## 3. Steps

### Step 1: Compile the `ncurses` Library

1. Download the source code for the `ncurses` library.
2. Configure the build for your target architecture using your cross-compilation toolchain.
3. Compile and install the `ncurses` library.

### Step 2: Compile the `nInvaders` Game

1. Download the `nInvaders` source code.
2. Configure the build to use the previously compiled `ncurses` library.
3. Compile the game.

### Step 3: Build a Minimal Root Filesystem and Kernel Image

1. Configure and compile the Linux kernel for your target board, ensuring the MPU6050 driver is included.
2. Create a device tree blob (DTB) for your target board, including the MPU6050 module.
3. Use a tool like Buildroot or Yocto to generate a minimal root filesystem that includes your compiled `ncurses` library and `nInvaders` game.
4. Compile the bootloader (e.g., U-Boot) for your target board.
5. Combine the bootloader, kernel, and root filesystem to create a bootable image for your target board.

### Step 4: Deploy the Image and Run the Game

1. Transfer the bootable image to your target board (e.g., via SD card, USB, or network).
2. Boot your target board with the new image.
3. Verify that the MPU6050 is detected by the kernel by checking the device tree and relevant device files (e.g., `/dev/i2c-*`).
4. Run the `nInvaders` game on the target board.

### Step 5: Enable Control of `nInvaders` Using MPU6050

You have multiple options to enable control of `nInvaders` using the MPU6050:

- **Option 1: Background Script**: Write a script that reads data from the MPU6050 and simulates keyboard inputs to control the game.
- **Option 2: Modify Game Source**: Modify the `nInvaders` source code to directly read inputs from the MPU6050 and use it to control the game.
- **Option 3: Modify MPU6050 Driver**: Modify the MPU6050 kernel driver to generate input events compatible with `nInvaders`.
- **Custom Option**: If you think of another approach to control the game with the MPU6050, feel free to implement it. This project encourages creativity and exploring different solutions.

### Step 6: Testing and Debugging

- Test each method and verify that the spaceship in the `nInvaders` game moves left or right based on the tilt of the MPU6050 module along the X-axis.
- Debug any issues by checking the kernel logs and ensuring that all software components are correctly integrated.

## 4. Expected Outcome

By the end of this exercise, you should have:

- A bootable Embedded Linux system running on your target board.
- The `nInvaders` game running on your target board with control input from the MPU6050 module.
- The spaceship in the game should move left or right based on the tilt along the X-axis of the MPU6050.
- A solid understanding of how to integrate user-space applications with kernel drivers and external hardware in an Embedded Linux system.

### Example Output (GIF)

## 5. Further Exploration

## 5. Further Exploration

To deepen your understanding, consider the following:

- **Explore Different Input Devices**: Try integrating other sensors or input devices to control the `nInvaders` game.
- **Optimize the Kernel**: Experiment with kernel optimization techniques to reduce the boot time and improve performance.
- **Create a Custom UI**: Use the `ncurses` library to create a custom user interface for the game or for system monitoring.
- **Experiment with Other Build Systems**: Try building the entire system using a different build system like Yocto or OpenEmbedded.
