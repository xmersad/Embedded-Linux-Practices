# Exercise: File Download via TFTP in U-Boot

## Introduction

In this exercise, you will learn how to implement a simple method for downloading files via TFTP (Trivial File Transfer Protocol) in U-Boot. This approach will demonstrate how to write a script as a C program within U-Boot, allowing for more reliable access to your file download functionality even if environment variables are unavailable after booting.

## Prerequisites

Before starting this exercise, ensure you have the following:

- Basic understanding of U-Boot and its command-line interface.
- Familiarity with C programming language.
- Access to a development environment where you can compile and test U-Boot.

## Steps

### Step 1: Understand the TFTP Protocol

Familiarize yourself with how the TFTP protocol works and how it can be utilized to transfer files between your target device and a TFTP server.

### Step 2: Write a C Program for TFTP File Download

1. Create a simple C program within the U-Boot source tree. This program will handle the TFTP file download process.
2. The C program should include the necessary functions to initialize the TFTP client, specify the server IP address, and the filename to be downloaded.

### Step 3: Integrate the C Program into U-Boot

1. Add your C program to the U-Boot build system, ensuring it gets compiled with the U-Boot binary.
2. Modify the U-Boot configuration to include your new command, which can be used to initiate the TFTP download.

### Step 4: Compile U-Boot

Compile the U-Boot source code with your modifications. Make sure there are no errors during the compilation process.

### Step 5: Test the TFTP File Download

1. Boot your target device with the newly compiled U-Boot.
2. Use the command you created to initiate a file download from the TFTP server.
3. Verify that the file has been successfully downloaded to the target device.

## Expected Outcome

By completing this exercise, you will have:

- A functional C program within U-Boot that enables file downloads via TFTP.
- An understanding of how to integrate custom commands into U-Boot.
- The ability to initiate file transfers even when environment variables are not accessible.
