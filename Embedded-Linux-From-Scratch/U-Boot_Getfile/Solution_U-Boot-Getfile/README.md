## Overview

This directory contains a simple U-Boot command implementation for downloading a file via TFTP and writing it to an MMC device. The command, `getfile`, takes three arguments: the filename, the device, and the partition.

### Code Explanation

The `do_getfile` function performs the following tasks:

1. Validates input arguments (filename, device, part).
2. Retrieves the `kernel_addr_r` environment variable, which specifies the address in RAM where the file will be downloaded.
3. Constructs and executes a command to download the file using TFTP and write it to the specified MMC device and partition using `fatwrite`.

### Usage

To use the `getfile` command, execute the following in the U-Boot prompt:

```
getfile <filename> <device> <part>
```

### File Placement

1. Place the code in a new file named `getfile.c` within the `cmd` directory of the U-Boot source tree:
   ```
   u-boot/cmd/getfile.c
   ```

### Adding to the Makefile

To include this new command in the build process, you need to modify the `Makefile` in the `cmd` directory:

1. Open `u-boot/cmd/Makefile`.
2. Add `getfile.o` to the list of objects, for example:
   ```makefile
   obj-y += getfile.o
   ```

### U-Boot Version

Ensure you are using U-Boot version **2023.10** for compatibility with this code.
