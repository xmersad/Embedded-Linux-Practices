This folder contains exercises and solutions designed to guide you through building an Embedded Linux system from scratch. By following the exercises, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how to configure, build, and deploy an embedded Linux system on a target device.

## Objectives

- Understanding Bootloaders: Learn about different bootloaders (e.g., U-Boot), their roles in the boot process, and how to configure and customize them for embedded systems.

- Kernel Configuration and Compilation: Explore the Linux kernel, how to configure it for specific hardware, and how to compile and deploy it on your target device.

- Root Filesystem Creation: Understand the structure of the root filesystem and learn how to build one from scratch using tools like BusyBox and Buildroot.

- Handling Various Memory Types: Learn how to work with different memory types such as RAM, ROM, and flash memory, and how to properly manage them in an embedded Linux environment.

- Boot Process: Understand the entire boot process of an embedded Linux system, from power-on to running a user application.
