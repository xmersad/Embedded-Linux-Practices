This folder contains exercises and solutions designed to guide you through building an Embedded Linux system from scratch. By following the exercises, you'll gain a deeper understanding of how to configure, build, and deploy an embedded Linux system on a target device.

## Objectives

- Understanding Bootloaders: Learn about different bootloaders (e.g., U-Boot), their roles in the boot process, and how to configure and customize them for embedded systems.

- Kernel Configuration and Compilation: Explore the Linux kernel, how to configure it for specific hardware, and how to compile and deploy it on your target device.

- Root Filesystem Creation: Understand the structure of the root filesystem and learn how to build one from scratch using tools like BusyBox and Buildroot.

- Handling Various Memory Types: Learn how to work with different memory types such as RAM, ROM, and flash memory, and how to properly manage them in an embedded Linux environment.

- Boot Process: Understand the entire boot process of an embedded Linux system, from power-on to running a user application.

## Exercise Structure

The exercises in this section are designed to be straightforward and concise, reflecting the simpler nature of the tasks. Each exercise includes two main sections:

1. **Explanations**: Brief descriptions that focus on the essential concepts and steps needed to complete the exercise. These explanations are generally shorter than those found in exercises from other parts of the repository, as the tasks are simpler and more focused.

2. **Expected Output**: A clear description of the expected result or output after completing the exercise. 

Depending on the complexity and requirements of each specific exercise, additional sections may be included, or some sections may be omitted. This flexibility allows for a more tailored approach to each task, ensuring that the most relevant information is provided.
