# Solution: Adding the `clear` Command to U-Boot

In this solution, we will add a `clear` command to U-Boot, which is not available by default. This command allows you to clear the terminal screen.

## Steps Taken:

1. **Create a C File**: 
   A C file named `cmd_clear.c` was created in the `cmd` directory. The content of the file is as follows:

   ```c
   #include <common.h>
   #include <command.h>

   typedef struct {
       char *name;
       int maxargs;
       int repeatable;
       int (*cmd)(struct cmd_tbl_s *cmdtp, int flag, int argc, char *const argv[]);
       char *usage;
   } cmd_tbl_t;

   static int do_clear(struct cmd_tbl_s *cmdtp, int flag, int argc, char *const argv[])
   {
       printf("\033[2J\033[H"); 
       return 0;
   }

   U_BOOT_CMD(
       clear, 1, 0, do_clear,
       "Clear screen",
       ""
   );```

2. **Modify the Makefile**: 
   In the `cmd` directory, the following line was added to the Makefile to include the new command:

   ``` makefile
   obj-$(CONFIG_CMD_CLEAR) += cmd_clear.o```

3. **Update the Board Configuration**:  
   The Raspberry Pi board configuration file located at `include/configs/rpi.h` was modified to enable the `clear` command by adding the following line:

   ```c
   #define CONFIG_CMD_CLEAR```


4. **Compile U-Boot**:  
   After making these changes, U-Boot was compiled. Any warnings during the build process are not a concern and can be safely ignored.

By following these steps, you can successfully add the `clear` command to U-Boot, enabling a cleaner terminal interface for user interaction.
