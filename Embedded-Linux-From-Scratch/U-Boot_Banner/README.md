# Exercise: Displaying a Banner in U-Boot

## Objective

In this exercise, you’ll modify U-Boot to display a custom banner during the boot process. The goal is to integrate a banner printing function at a specific point in U-Boot’s execution.

## Steps

1. **Create a Banner Program**:
   - Write a small program that converts your custom text into character art for display as a banner. You can implement this in C and later integrate it into U-Boot.

2. **Include the Banner Code**:
   - After writing your banner program, include its header and call the `show_banner()` function at an appropriate point in U-Boot’s boot sequence. 
   - You can explore U-Boot's codebase to find the best place to insert the function or use your own approach to display the banner.

3. **Optional**:
   - For a dynamic banner, consider exploring U-Boot’s configuration system to allow the banner text to be set at build time using `Kconfig`.

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this exercise, U-Boot should display your custom banner during the boot process, before proceeding with the rest of the system initialization.
