# Embedded Linux Practices

Welcome to the Embedded Linux Project repository! This repository is focused on providing hands-on exercises to help you practice and enhance your skills in Embedded Linux development. The exercises are categorized into different sections, each targeting a specific area of Embedded Linux systems.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into two main sections:

### 1. Embedded Linux from Scratch
This section covers the foundational aspects of building an Embedded Linux system from the ground up. It’s designed for those who want to understand the core components of an Embedded Linux system and how they interact. The topics in this section include:

- **Boot Loader**: Learn how to configure and compile a bootloader, such as U-Boot, which is essential for initializing the hardware and loading the kernel.
- **Root Filesystem (rootfs)**: Understand how to create a minimal root filesystem using tools like BusyBox, and learn about different filesystem types suitable for embedded systems.
- **Kernel Image**: Learn how to configure, compile, and optimize the Linux kernel for specific hardware platforms.
- **Toolchain**: Get hands-on experience with cross-compilation toolchains, essential for building software on a host machine for a target embedded device.

Each of these topics is broken down into individual exercises that guide you through the process of building a fully functional Embedded Linux system from scratch. This section is ideal for those new to Embedded Linux or those looking to reinforce their foundational knowledge.

### 2. Embedded Linux System Integration
This section is focused on more advanced topics, primarily dealing with the integration of various software components into a complete Embedded Linux system. The exercises in this section are designed to simulate real-world projects where you will:

- **Program Compilation**: Practice compiling various user-space programs and libraries for embedded systems, and understand how to resolve dependencies.
- **Licensing Considerations**: Learn about the different open-source licenses applicable to Embedded Linux projects and how to comply with them.
- **Build Tools (Make, CMake, Meson)**: Gain proficiency in using build tools to manage complex software projects. Each tool is covered with examples to help you understand its strengths and use cases.
- **Embedded Linux Stacks**: Explore different software stacks commonly used in embedded systems, such as networking stacks, GUI toolkits, and middleware.

This section often includes complete project examples where you will integrate multiple components into a cohesive system. It’s ideal for those who have a foundational understanding of Embedded Linux and want to apply their knowledge to more complex scenarios.

## How to Navigate the Repository

- **Exercises**: Each folder contains a series of exercises that are designed to be practical and hands-on.
  - The exercises are documented in README files or separate files within each folder.
  - The exercises aim to challenge your understanding and application of concepts in real-world scenarios.

- **Solutions**: A solution folder is provided with one approach to solving the exercises. The solutions are meant to guide you, but feel free to explore alternative methods. For larger projects, in addition to the documentation and detailed explanations, an ISO file is provided. This ISO file contains a pre-built version of the project, allowing you to easily test and run the project without going through the entire build process.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/xmersad/embedded-linux-project.git
